1. whenever you are making a form and make the method of the form post and the action will /submit like this 
<form id="myForm" action="/submit" method="POST">


2. In your HTML form, you can use the name attribute to specify the name of the form field,
 and that's what you should be looking for in your server-side code to retrieve the form data.
 (form likhte waqt name wala imp hai aur usi se server side code ko pata chalega kis exact chiz ki baat ho rahi hai)


3. for using this -> req.body.name or req.body.city we need to use body parser 

4. for mongo db we have to first connect the database with mongoose and then we have to create a schema for all the collections and then 
we have to add/store the data
